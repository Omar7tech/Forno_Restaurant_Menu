                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    Welcome to <strong>Forno Flatbread Co. – Aley</strong>, where the warmth of Mediterranean
                    tradition meets the artistry of Italian cuisine. Our restaurant brings to life the beloved
                    <em>manakish</em> and <em>man’ousheh</em> — thin, freshly baked flatbreads with perfectly crisp
                    edges,
                    topped with a variety of meats, cheeses, and garden-fresh vegetables.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                    More than just flatbreads, our menu offers a delicious selection of wood-fired pizzas,
                    wraps made with fresh pita dough, hearty pasta dishes, crisp salads, and indulgent desserts —
                    all prepared with care and passion. Each bite is crafted to celebrate flavor, comfort,
                    and the joy of sharing food with loved ones.
                </p>
